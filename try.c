// step 1: First we compiled our code using "make cash" command.
// step 2: On successful compilation, Now we run our program therefore we execute our main function...
int main(void)
{
    // step 3: Now we're in our main function or we can say the control of our program now is in main function and it (machine) is reading first line of actual code excluding comments.
    // Ask how many cents the customer is owed
    // step 4 (a): Machine reads this line given just below, So here's a call for "get_cents" function...
    // step 4 (b): Machine checks it's return type and how many arguments this function takes. Machine will check and will say (Okay it's a function which returns an integer and here we're receiving that returned integer into a variable called "cents" which is also a integer type variable and that seems okay to me. This function takes no arguments and no arguments are passed into the function, that's also seems okay. Since everything is good and okay, Machine will execute that function call and machine will hand over the control to "get_cents" function. So let's go to get_cents function definition...)
    int cents = get_cents(); // step 17: Here we come again üòé with an exciting value 99. Okay let's move forward.

    // Calculate the number of quarters to give the customer
    // step 18: Now it's all seems like same story but with some new different interesting values. From here, we're abstracting some vocab transcripted guide. Therefore now we know what machine will do next. Machine will sanitize (Actually our programmed is already sanitized because we already compiled. That we explained above isn't false but technically that's. I explained that to understand code control flow). Machine will simply call "calculate_quarters" function. You know where step 19 is üòâ.
    int quarters = calculate_quarters(cents); // step 25: Machine: Variable "quarters" is now holds value 3 got from function "calculate_quarters" call.

    // Note (IMP): quarters = 3 and still cents = 99. ‚úî ‚ö†

    // step 26: Machine: Woww, Some more arithmetics to do...
    // step 27: Machine: "cents = cents - quarters * 25" (where, cents = 99, quarters = 3
    // step 28: Machine: "quarters * 25" (quarters = 3)
    // step 28: Machine: "cents = cents - 3 * 25"       <- this is due to the associativity and precedence. right to left for "=" (associativity) and multiply first (precedence).
    // step 29: Machine: "cents = cents - 75".
    // step 30: Machine: "cents = 99 - 75"          <- (left cents): expects to not change and receive some value in the end from right side of "=" operator. cents and quarters both are operands. right "cents" interpolated to value 99.
    // step 31: Machine: "cents = 24".
    cents = cents - quarters * 25;

    // Note (IMP): Now cents = 24 and quarters = 3. ‚úî ‚ö†
    // tip: Noticed? How we calculated quarters and updated cents value. First we divided cents by 25 and got 3 and then we also used that quarters value 3 to remove compressed values (we compressed 75 into 3) from cents. 99 - 75 = 24.

    // break: 99 => 99 / 25 = 3.
    // adjust: 99 => 99 - 25 * 3 = 24. (75 + 24 = 99)
    // final value for cents: 24.

    // Calculate the number of dimes to give the customer
    // step 31: Now we know we have, cents = 24, quarters = 3.
    // Note: Here placement of functions calculate_quarters and then calculate_dimes and so on... have you noticed the pattern?
    // Pattern is, First we need to eliminate or get highest coins change then we eliminate or calculate next highest but lower than quarters, coins value which is what? dimes and then pattern goes down higher to lower.
    // What if function "calculate_dime" was calculated first and function "calculate_quarters" calculated later??
    // Answer: We lost the highest efficient change of coins which was quarters.
    // for example: cents was equals to 99... cents = 99, calculate_dimes first... 99 / 10 = 9 and remaining cents = 9 and then we calculate nickels =>... 9 / 5 = 1 and cents = 4.... pennies = 4.
    // So total would be what => 9 + 1 + 4 = 14 and that's wrong ‚ùå
    // Hope you will understand functions placements and their execution chronology.

    // step 32: Machine: Aaaan, It's simple, let's go inside to function "calculate_dime" with an argument which is cents and cents are 24 remained....
    int dimes = calculate_dimes(cents); // step 38: Now, dimes = 2.

    // step 39: Machine: Arithmetics, It's my left hand work üòé.
    // step 40: Machine: cents = 24, dimes = 2.
    // step 41: Machine: cents = cents - 2 * 10
    // step 42: Machine: cents = cents - 20
    // step 43: Machine: cents = 24 - 20
    // step 44: Machine: cents = 4.
    cents = cents - dimes * 10;

    // Note (IMP): Now cents = 4, quarters = 3, dimes = 2 ‚úî ‚ö†

    // Calculate the number of nickels to give the customer
    // step 45: Machine let's call calculate_nickels function with an actual argument / parameter cents = 4.
    int nickels = calculate_nickels(cents); // step 51: nickels = 0

    // step 52: cents = cents - nickels * 5;
    // step 53: cents = cents - 0 * 5;
    // step 54: cents = cents - 0;
    // step 55: cents = 4 - 0.
    // step 56: cents = 4.  // That's one more prominent reason for functions choronlogical placements top to bottom or higher or lower.
    cents = cents - nickels * 5;

    // Note (IMP): Now cents = 4, quarters = 3, dimes = 2, nickels = 0 ‚úî ‚ö†

    // Calculate the number of pennies to give the customer
    // step 56: It's a useless function why?? notice we are doing nothing but dividing cents by integer 1 inside calculate_pennies function and multiplying calculated pennies again by 1 and obviously we know it's worthless.
    int pennies = calculate_pennies(cents); // step 58: pennies = 4;
    // step 59: cents = cents - pennies * 1;
    // step 60: cents = cents - 4 * 1;
